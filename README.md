# Credit Card Benefits Guide

Welcome to the GitHub page for the handy-dandy Credit Card Benefits Guide. The aim of this site is to provide a quick reference guide to some key benefits of various credit cards. 

### Contributing 

Please navigate to the [_posts](https://github.com/nicroth/credit-card-benefits/tree/master/_posts) directory and add any content you feel. Issue a Pull Request and we'll get it merged. 

Note that each post requires some basic content. I'm using the `category` to separate cards by issuing bank.

### Data Sources

Data contributed is mostly sourced from the physical or PDF copy of a specific "Guide to Benefits" of a credit card. Typically a cardholder will receive this in the mail as part of the welcome kit for that particular card.
